# World-Population-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
World Population Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project is an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing world population data from 1970 to 2022. The goal was to clean the data, explore various demographic trends, and present the findings through data visualizations. The analysis provides valuable insights into global and continental population shifts, growth rates, and density.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis.

Pandas: Essential for data manipulation, cleaning, and filtering.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Used for creating a variety of data visualizations, including bar charts and scatter plots.

Jupyter Notebook: The environment where the entire analysis was performed and documented.

Analysis & Key Findings
The project notebook walks through the complete data analysis process, from initial data loading to generating final visualizations. Key areas of focus included:

Data Cleaning: Checking for and handling missing values to ensure data quality.

Top Populated Countries: Identifying and visualizing the top 10 most populous countries in 2022.

Population by Continent: Analyzing and comparing the total population and growth rates for each continent.

Population Density: Calculating and visualizing the density of countries to understand population concentration.

Growth Rate Analysis: Exploring the relationship between a country's rank and its growth rate to find interesting trends.

How to Run the Project
To replicate this analysis, you will need to have a Python environment with the required libraries.
